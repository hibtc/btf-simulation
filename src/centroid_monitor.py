# Definition of a beam element with an internal data recording #
################################################################

# We define a data structure to allow all elements of a new BeamElement type
# to store data in one place. Such a data structure needs to contain a field called
# `_index` of type `xtrack.RecordIndex`, which will be used internally to
# keep count of the number of records stored in the data structure. Together with
# the index, the structure can contain an arbitrary number of other fields (which
# need to be arrays) where the data will be stored.

class CentroidRecord(xo.Struct):

    at_turn = xo.Int64[:]
    x_cen = xo.Float64[:]
    y_cen = xo.Float64[:]
    
# To allow elements of a given type to store data in a structure of the type defined
# above we need to add in the element class an attribute called
# `_internal_record_class` to which we bind the data structure type defined above.
